#### Stripe Menus consists of a straightforward user interface where there is a

- **Navbar**, **Hero**, **Sidebar** and **Submenu** components.
- Functionality is 
  - **`Navbar`**  consists of the title `Stripe`  logo, page menus, and `Sign in` button.
  - **`Hero`** consists of a header, paragraph, and `Start now`  button.
  - **`Sidebar`** will appear as an alternative to Navbar to show the page menus when the user is on mobile view for a flexible user experience.
  - Each **`Submenu`** is a page with a menu of `Sublinks` / `Submenus`which is implemented in a way with smooth transiton while switching instead of vertical menus.
  - Data has not been set for any of the Submenus routes but **Netlify** handles them as *Page not Found* and buttons are not given any click functionality.
- Data is handled by **`data.js`** and styles are handled by **`index.css`**
- To run the project locally, clone the repo, `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm start` to start up the development server on default port 3000.
